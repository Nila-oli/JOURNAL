# JOURNAL

## WEEK 1
### DAY 1

Introduced myself and got to know my fellow interns.

Met the mentors, who shared their introductions and explained their roles.

Participated in a session where mentors asked about what we had learned during the training period.

Took part in a Q&A session to clarify doubts about the internship program and job expectations.

#### What I Learned:

Understood the structure of the internship program and the mentors’ expectations.

Realized the importance of reflecting on my training knowledge to apply it during the internship.

### DAY 2

Morning session: Learned about Generative AI, Amazon Bedrock, Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Prompt Engineering, Prompt Engineering Techniques, and Amazon Bedrock Guardrails.

Afternoon session: Participated in a Generative AI – Amazon Bedrock “Zero to Hero” workshop.

Completed the following lab tasks:

Lab 0: Reviewed and set up workshop resources.

Lab 1: Practiced Bedrock Prompt Engineering.

Lab 2: Worked with Bedrock Knowledge Bases.

Lab 3: Learned about Bedrock Agents (created a knowledge base and an agent).

Lab 4: Explored Bedrock Guardrails.

#### What I Learned:

Gained a strong understanding of how Generative AI works within AWS.

Learned practical applications of prompt engineering and how to design effective prompts.

Discovered how to use Bedrock Knowledge Bases and Agents for AI workflows.

Understood the importance of guardrails in ensuring safe and responsible AI outputs.

### DAY 3

concepts:

Foundation Models and their role in generative AI.

Content Generation using large language models.

Chatbots – basics, chatbot with embeddings, and chatbot with RAG.

Embedding and Text Similarity Applications.

Vector Databases and their use in storing and searching embeddings.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and its importance in enhancing chatbot responses.

Workshop : Amazon Bedrock Intensive Development Workshop labs, which included:

Working with foundation models for text and image generation.

Parameter tuning to optimize model outputs.

Applying prompt engineering basics in practical exercises.

Developing a conversational chatbot.

Exploring embedding with vector databases.

Building a chatbot with natural language search.

Implementing a chatbot with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

#### What I Learned:

How foundation models can be adapted for text and image generation.

The importance of parameter tuning for improving output quality.

Practical applications of embeddings and how they work with vector databases.

How to integrate RAG into chatbots to make them smarter and more context-aware.

Understood the progression from a simple chatbot to chatbots with embeddings and RAG for better contextual responses.

Explored how embeddings and vector databases power similarity search and natural language queries.
